### Game Version

On Build, deploy the game but set a variable based on something. This will add a version number to the bottom right hand corner of the welcome scene.

### Prestige System

After reaching 1million energy you can spend it to prestige.
Every 1 million you earn gives you a prestige point. These can then be used when you prestige.

Every time you prestige you start with 100 extra money. So you can just spam prestiges if you want so you start faster.

#### Prestige Rewards

On prestige 1 you unlock the roller from the start.
On 2 you unlock the knight
On 3 you unlock the ship
On 4 you unlock the rook


#### Offline Processing
Makes it so the passive energy will work while offline.

#### Queen - Single Use
Unlocks the queen which rolls all dice in an XxX area around them.

#### King - Single Use
Unlocks the king which gives multipliers to all dice around them.


#### ???? - "Final Unlock"

Random characters will move into the game and make a life.
This will make the game silly and have little characters that will feed off dice to live.

#### Building Costs

Make it cheaper to place buildings.
